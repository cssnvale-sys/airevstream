## Session 2 — 2026-03-17 (Late Morning)

### Summary
Minor configuration change — switched default AI model.

### What Was Done
- Changed default Ollama model from `llama3.2` to `qwen3:8b` (user's local model)

### Commits
- `6be5909` chore: change default AI model to qwen3:8b

## Session 3 — 2026-03-17/18 (Evening–Night)

### Summary
Integration packages, expanded AI service registry, platform adapters, PRD Epics 2-9, dashboard expansion, and audit round 1.

### What Was Done
- **Integration Packages:**
  - `@airevstream/audio-engine` — TTS client (Piper local + ElevenLabs cloud), placeholder fallback (5 tests)
  - `@airevstream/browser-automation` — Stealth Playwright contexts, Bezier mouse paths, Gaussian delays, QWERTY typos, proxy rotation, session persistence, 4 platform workflows (3 tests)
- **AI Service Registry** (D009): Evolved ai-client into multi-provider registry with fallback chains, circuit breaker, health monitoring, cost tracking
- **Platform Posting Adapters:** YouTube (resumable upload), TikTok (PULL_FROM_URL), Instagram (container publish), Facebook (Graph API)
- **ComfyUI Workflows:** 4 SDXL templates (thumbnail, scenery, avatar, storyboard-frame)
- **Remotion Compositions:** 3 compositions (short 9:16, long 16:9, thumbnail still) with H.I.C.C. beat timing
- **PRD Epics 1-9:** All completed (foundation, account ops, content gen, video production, distribution, intelligence layer, affiliate/monetization, optimization/scale, SaaS preparation)
- **Dashboard Expansion:** 14 views + notification center + SSE real-time updates, 99 API route files
- **Audit Round 1 (5.8):** AI chat/script/shot wired to real AI, security hardening, DB-backed settings, tenant scoping, real SSE, error retry

### Key Decisions
- D009: Multi-provider AI Service Registry with fallback chains
- D010: CSS variable design system with RGB channel format
- D011: Next.js API routes as Backend-for-Frontend
- D012: SWR for client-side data fetching

### Open Items
- Multiple frontend↔API data shape mismatches discovered (addressed in Session 4)

---

## Session 4 — 2026-03-18

### Summary
Audit rounds 2 and 3 — systematic frontend↔API data shape fixes.

### What Was Done
- **Audit Round 2 (5.11):**
  - Analytics overview API route
  - Settings form field mapping fixes
  - AI service DELETE endpoint
  - Platform filter fix
  - Metrics shape fix
  - Workflows/approvals pages
  - ApprovedBy audit trail
  - Content [id] tenant scoping
  - Health check pings
  - Security settings route
- **Audit Round 3 (5.12):** ~30 frontend↔API data shape fixes:
  - Content POST handler
  - Calendar start/end params
  - @airevstream/ai-client dependency
  - Dashboard activity/revenue/health/workflow shapes
  - Status bar auth
  - Notification center paginated response
  - System page severity/status/jobType fields
  - Analytics mock data removal
  - Create page shot error handling

### Issues Found
- Data shape mismatches were the #1 bug class (frontend expected different field names/types than API returned)
- Several API routes used `getDb()` instead of `ctx.db`, bypassing tenant scoping

### Open Items
- More data shape issues found during round 3 review (addressed in Session 5)

## Session 5 — 2026-03-18

### Summary
Audit round 4 — final wave of fixes + git commit organization.

### What Was Done
- Ran 5 parallel audit agents (dashboard, system, calendar+create+analytics, notifications+settings, API routes)
- Found ~30 new issues across settings, dashboard, system, create, analytics pages
- Fixed all via 5 parallel fix agents
- **Audit Round 4 (5.13):**
  - Settings: `chain.chain→services` crash fix, `serviceType` field, notifications `type` vs `channel`, API keys `keyPrefix`, removed invalid embedding type
  - Dashboard: approval `channelName→channel.name`, `qualityScore` Decimal type, `status=pending_approval`, dead code removal
  - System: workflows status filter removed (errors now visible), unused import, nullable `AlertItem.message`
  - Create: storyboard `durationSeconds→duration`, shot async status handling, `generate-script` affiliateProductId
  - Analytics: `revenueOverTime` from DB, `costByModel` aggregation, missing fields with graceful empty arrays
- Committed all uncommitted work into 4 logical commits:
  1. `815576d` — backend: integration packages, service registry, platform adapters
  2. `92e1515` — frontend: web dashboard pages, API routes, components
  3. `1b49182` — docs: tracking docs and root configs
  4. `eae6f2e` — chore: build artifacts in .gitignore

### Key Decisions
- D013–D017 (see DECISIONS.md): Prisma Decimal serialization, generationParams JSON storage, workflow job filtering, analytics graceful degradation, 4-commit git structure

### Issues Found
- See KNOWN-ISSUES.md for remaining limitations
- 14+ API routes with silent catch blocks (no logging)
- E2E tests not set up (Playwright not installed)

### Open Items
- E2E testing (Playwright) not started
- PM2 production config is partial
- Platform posting adapters untested against real APIs
- Browser automation untested in production
